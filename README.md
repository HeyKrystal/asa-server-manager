The primary goal in developing this script was to make an ark management tool that embodied "set it and forget it". This tool provides several functions for starting and maintaining an Ark Survival Ascended server that, when paired with task scheduler, provides a very low maintenance experience. You can schedule nightly restarts that will automatically backup saves to a specified location. The server will automatically check for updates and install them before running. Backups and updates can also be requested on demand, as long as the server is not already running to prevent corruption. Backups are also compressed to save space. (Install WinRAR for better compression. The script will use it automatically if you have it installed.)  Protections are also in place so that only one instance of this script can be executed at any given time, again to prevent corruption. This script also has a setup function that will download the tools you need and setup the project structure required by the script. Actions for this script are kept in logs to help determine unexpected issues. This script also allows you to queue up changes to your config files for next restart.
